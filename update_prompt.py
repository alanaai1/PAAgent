Analyze these insights and create ACTUAL DELIVERABLES (not suggestions):

{result.stdout}

For each actionable item, CREATE THE ACTUAL WORK PRODUCT:
- If email needed: Write the complete email (subject, body, recipient)
- If document needed: Write the full document with all content
- If meeting prep needed: Create the complete brief with questions and answers
- If schedule needed: Write the calendar invite with agenda

NO PLACEHOLDERS. NO "insert here". NO meta-advice.
ACTUAL DELIVERABLES ONLY.
