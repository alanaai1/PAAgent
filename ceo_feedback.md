# Business Focus Enhancement
def enhance_business_response(self, message):

    # Add business context to all responses
    return self.add_business_context(response)

```

### Action Orientation - HIGH Priority
**Suggestion:** Include specific actionable steps and next actions

# Action Orientation Enhancement
def add_action_items(self, response):
    action_items = [
        "Immediate next steps:",
        "1. [Specific action]",
        "2. [Timeline]",
        "3. [Expected outcome]"
    ]
    return response + "\n\n" + "\n".join(action_items)

```

### Clarity - MEDIUM Priority
**Suggestion:** Improve sentence structure and readability

**Code Improvement:**
```python

# Clarity Enhancement
def improve_clarity(self, response):
    # Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones
    sentences = response.split('.')
    improved_sentences = []
    for sentence in sentences:
        if len(sentence.split()) > 15:
            # Split long sentences
            improved_sentences.extend(self.split_long_sentence(sentence))
        else:
            improved_sentences.append(sentence)
    return '. '.join(improved_sentences)
