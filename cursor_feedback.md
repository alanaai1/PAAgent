ðŸŽ¯ **CEO Review Feedback - Cycle 16**

ðŸ“Š **Jarvis Performance Score**: 0.47/1.0
ðŸ’¼ **CEO Verdict**: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - Lacks sufficient business focus and actionable guidance

ðŸ”§ **Improvements Needed**:

**Business Focus** - HIGH Priority
â€¢ Issue: Enhance business vocabulary and revenue-focused language
â€¢ Code to implement:
```python

# Business Focus Enhancement
def enhance_business_response(self, message):
    business_keywords = ["revenue", "pipeline", "growth", "customers", "deals"]
    # Add business context to all responses
    return self.add_business_context(response)

```

**Clarity** - MEDIUM Priority
â€¢ Issue: Improve sentence structure and readability
â€¢ Code to implement:
```python

# Clarity Enhancement
def improve_clarity(self, response):
    # Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones
    sentences = response.split('.')
    improved_sentences = []
    for sentence in sentences:
        if len(sentence.split()) > 15:
            # Split long sentences
            improved_sentences.extend(self.split_long_sentence(sentence))
        else:
            improved_sentences.append(sentence)
    return '. '.join(improved_sentences)

```

ðŸš€ **Next Steps for Cursor**:
1. Review this CEO feedback
2. Implement the suggested improvements in api_server.py
3. Test the improvements
4. Let me know when ready for re-testing

**Please implement these improvements and respond with 'IMPROVEMENTS_READY' when done.**
